                and
                its

            </p>

            <p>
                Tai Lifestyle was primarily formed to carryout Safe Management of hazardous waste
                emanating from
                oil
                and oil Products hence, collect, transport and dispose waste oil and sludge according
                the NEMA
                regulations and guidelines. Waste generation occurs from all these numerous human
                activities,
                which
                creates the need for proper management to protect both the environment and our health.

            </p>
            <p>
                In this regard, we owned a NEMA fully Licensed Treatment plant/disposal site located in
                Mikindani,
                off Mombasa â€“Mariakani Road, coupled with License to transport the aforesaid waste.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over the years, the need for diversity and growth has necessitated expansion of our
                scope to
                include
                handling, transportation and disposal of asbestos. Therefore, we own another disposal
                site,
                whose
                Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been done and respective Disposal License
                issued
                accordingly. This site is located in Maungu, about 30 kilometers from Voi town.
            </p>

            <p>
                Asbestos disposal basically involves removal of old hazardous roofing sheets, wrapping
                them with
                recommended polythene bags and tapes, transportation and subsequent disposal at NEMA
                authorized
                site
            </p>

            <p>
                Since in every building where old sheets are removed will require re-roofing for
                replacement,
                this
                has in turn made us venture into building and construction so that
                we can offer a complete package to our clientele.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the above foregoing, we are registered with National Construction Authority Category
                for (4)
                for
                Building, road works and water work contractor.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our commitment to offer professional services and products tailored to serve the
                interest of our
                clientele cannot be over-emphasized. We look forward to opportunities that will give us
