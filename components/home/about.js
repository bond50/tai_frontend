                                        Over the years, the need for diversity and growth has necessitated expansion of
                                        our scope to include handling, transportation and disposal of asbestos.
                                        Therefore, we own another disposal site, whose Environmental Impact Assessment
                                        (EIA) has been done and respective Disposal License issued accordingly. This
                                        site is located in Maungu, about 30 kilometers from Voi town.
