Therefore we own another disposal site, whose Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) has been done and respective Disposal License issued accordingly. This site is located in Maungu, about 30 kilometers from Voi town.\n\nAsbestos disposal basically involve removal of old hazardous roofing sheets, wrapping them with recommended polythene bags and tapes, transportation and subsequent disposal at NEMA authorized site\n\nSince in every building where old sheets are removed will require re-roofing for replacement, this has in turn made us venture into building and construction so that \nwe can offer a complete package to our clientele.\n\nIn the above foregoing, we are registered with National Construction Authority Category for (4) for Building, road works and water works contractor.\n \nOur commitment to offer professional services and products tailored to serve the interest of our clientele cannot be over-emphasized.
